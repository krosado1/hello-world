# hello-world
First assignment for FreeCodeCamp. 

Hello everyone.

I am a producer/actor. I'm a naturally strategic thinker (according to the aptitude tests), and a kinesthetic learner (according to the scores of angry teachers throughout my academic career yelling, "Don't touch that!")

Coding has always been extremely intriguing to me, and I'm very grateful to have found FreeCodeCamp. I am an absolute novice, but I'm excited to have a plan to follow and several goals to accomplish. Very motivating! 

I hope to meet interesting new people and have the opportunity to work on compelling projects. 

I also hope I don't flake out of the program before I've accomplished something meaningful. [insert: foreboding emoji]

Cheers!

Keila R.
